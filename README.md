# PCB-Dashboard
In this interactive Streamlit dashboard, I used NumPy to randomly generate data to create visualizations for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), specifically aroclors. In the dashboard, you can filter by sample, or by sample matrix (water, soil, oil) and see how the resulting bar graph of concentration changes. All visualizations were created using Plotly Express.
